===================
 Testing the Setup
===================

A very basic test will show you whether the connection is working
between the Minecraft server and the IPython notebook server.

#. In IPython, click on the :guilabel:`exercises` folder to navigate
   to where the classroom exercises are stored.

#. Click on :guilabel:`Exercise 1 -- Hello World!` to open the
   notebook for the first exercise. Your screen should look roughly
   like the following:

   .. image:: _images/hello-world-notebook.png

#. Choose :menuselection:`Cell --> Run All` from the menu.

#. In the Minecraft game, look for the ``Hello Minecraft!``
   message. If you don't see it, try opening chat by typing
   :kbd:`T`. You should see something like the following:

   .. image:: _images/hello-world-minecraft.png


If this works, fantastic! You are ready to continue on with the
:doc:`exercises <exercises>`.
